# asleep: a sleep classifier for wearable sensor data using machine learning
This is a Python package for classifying sleep stages from wearable sensor data / wrist - worn accelerometer. The underlying model
was trained and tested in 1000 + nights of multi - centre polysomnography with tri - axial accelerometer data.

The key features of this package are as follows:
* A simple and easy - to - use API for sleep stage classification.
* Sleep / wake metric estimation including total sleep duration and sleep efficiency.
* Sleep architecture metric estimation including rapid - eye - movement(REM) / NREM sleep duration.

# Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Java 8 (1.8.0) or greater

Check with:
```bash
$ python --version
$ java -version
```

# Installation
```bash
$ pip install asleep
```

# Usage
All the processing will be much faster after the first time because the model weights will to have to be downloaded
the first time that the package is used.
```shell
# Process an AX3 file
$ get_sleep sample.cwa

# Or an ActiGraph file
$ get_sleep sample.gt3x

# Or a GENEActiv file
$ get_sleep sample.bin

# Or a CSV file (see data format below)
$ get_sleep sample.csv
```

Output
```shell

# Processing CSV files
If a CSV file is provided, it must have the following header: time, x, y, z.

Example:
```shell
time, x, y, z
2013 - 10 - 21 10: 00: 08.000, -0.078923, 0.396706, 0.917759
2013 - 10 - 21 10: 00: 08.010, -0.094370, 0.381479, 0.933580
2013 - 10 - 21 10: 00: 08.020, -0.094370, 0.366252, 0.901938
2013 - 10 - 21 10: 00: 08.030, -0.078923, 0.411933, 0.901938
